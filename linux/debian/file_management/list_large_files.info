The du command is used to estimate the space used by a file or directory. We can pipe the output of the du command to the sort command to sort the files by size. Then use the head command to print the first few lines of the output.

 du -sh * | sort -rh | head -1

Open the terminal and type this command. It will list the largest files and directories under the current directory.

We use the following commands in our examples.

Command Description
du -sh  Display file and directory size in human-readable format
sort -rh        Reverse the result based on human-readable numbers
head -1 Display the first largest files


du -sh * | sort -rh | head -1
